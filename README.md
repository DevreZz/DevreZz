  <strong>Ahoi. üëãüèΩ</strong>

  Since I was a kid I've dreamed 
  about working with technology.
  
  As an adult, I made my choices,
  first of all, 
  I started by studying eletronics.
  Times going by, I
  had the chance to work
  as an English teacher,

  
  so I got this job to support my dreamjob.
  
  After that,
  I got a graduation in Philosophy
  and there I learnt a lot about logics.

  Now, as a teacher I can affort 
  my studies and become a software engineer
  of success.

  <strong> more about me.</strong>
  A bass player and games lover, I like to spend my leisure time by doing this kind of things.
  I also love animals, special my two dogs. Patient, curious and creative, my fuel is coffee and I enjoy Japanese food.
  I'm a people person who always tries to help everyone in need.
  On weekends, why not a road trip by motorcycle? =)
