  <strong>Ahoi. 👋🏽</strong>

  Since I was a kid I've dreamed about working
  with technology. As an adult, I made my choices,
  first of all, I started by studying eletronics.
  Times going by, I had the chance to work as an English teacher,
  so I got this job to support my dream. After that,
  I got a graduation in Philosophy and there I learnt a lot about logics.
  Now, as a teacher I can affort 
  my studies and become a software engineer of success.
